# UFO javaScript Analysis

Using javsScript, HTML, CSS, and D3, I created a website to filter a users unput and display the related infomration. 

## HTML File


that was linked to a js file. The js file stores the database information and displays information based on the user's input. I used an index.html file linked to an app.js file. The html file contained the code for the display of the webpage and the app.js file contained the code for the functionality. 

In my javaSCript file, I created a variable and linked it to my data, used D3 to select the button feature from the html file, and assigned event listeners to the button activity. 

I used a function to run an event handler to diplay the user input. The code collects the user input and feeds it through an arrow function to display the data. Prior to displaying the data, I used tbody.html("") to clear out the data.
